# Robot-War-Simulator-in-C-
A turn-based warfare simulator where robots battle in a 2D grid. Robots perform actions like moving, looking, and firing based on their unique abilities. The project uses multiple inheritance to model various robot types and runs until only one robot remains or time runs out.
