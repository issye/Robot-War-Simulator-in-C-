# Robot-War-Simulator-in-C-
This project implements a turn-based robot warfare simulator in C++. Robots battle in a 2D m x n matrix battlefield, following strategic actions like moving, looking, and firing. Each robot's position remains hidden, and they must act based on their abilities, which include movement, vision, and shooting. The simulation continues until a single robot remains or time runs out. The project leverages inheritance with a base abstract class and multiple subclasses, showcasing different robot types and their unique capabilities.
